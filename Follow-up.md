Bellow are described few tracks on how to follow-up 

### Using pan-learning

Access to jupyterhub should remain open after the course and you are welcome to continue using it.

#### Local installation
If you prefer to set up local installation of jupyter notebook or lab you can do following

1. Download anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#download-section

2. Clone repository with notebooks by e.g. typing in terminal: *git clone https://github.com/ess-dmsc-dram/python-course-ikon.git*

4. Open Anaconda Navigator and then click on *Launch* Jupyter notebook or lab


5. Then navigate to the folder with the cloned repository. 
6. *Optional:* While jupyter basics and python basics should work without any problem, to be able to run other notebooks you will need to access aditional packages. This can be done by installing packages in anaconda e.g.: 
*conda install  -c conda-forge  numpy matplotlib scipy pandas h5py hdf5 scikit-learn ipywidgets ase nglview scipp pythreejs ipympl ipykernel<=6.3.1*
